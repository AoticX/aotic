# AOTIC CRM — Development Checklist (Deployment Readiness)

Last updated: 2026-03-31 (session 3)
Go-live target: First week of April

> **Status (2026-03-31)**: All 14 modules have frontend implemented. 43 routes, 0 build errors.
> DB schema is fully aligned — 10 migrations applied to fix column mismatches discovered during QA.
> Remaining work is polish, edge cases, and client-provided data (GST number, logo, inventory list).

## Legend
- 🔴 BLOCKING — app cannot ship without this
- 🟠 HIGH — significant feature gap per contract

- 🟢 DONE — implemented and verified

---

## MODULE 1 — Auth & Roles

- [x] 🟢 Lead capture form (name, phone, car, service, budget, source — 8 channels)

- [ ] 🟠 **Lead assignment UI** — `assignLead` action exists but no dropdown/button on lead detail for manager to reassign
- [ ] 🟡 **Activity log on manager/front-desk views** — `CommunicationLog` only on sales lead detail; manager and front-desk can't log activities

---

## MODULE 3 — Quotation Builder

- [x] 🟢 Multi-line quotation builder (add/remove items)

- [x] 🟢 96 service packages seeded (6 verticals × 4 tiers × 4 segments)
- [x] 🟢 Discount hard-lock: ≤5% auto-approved, >5% → owner approval required
- [x] 🟢 Every discount requires a reason code (`discount_reasons` seeded)

---

- [ ] 🟠 **Technician assignment UI** — `assignTechnician` action exists but the button/modal on job detail is minimal; multiple technicians not well-supported from UI
- [ ] 🟠 **Rework flow** — after QC fail → `rework_scheduled` status set, but no UI to: add rework notes to technician, reassign, set rework deadline, re-trigger QC
- [ ] 🟡 **Time tracking per task** — timer logs at job level; no breakdown by sub-task

- [ ] 🟡 Delete `seed-demo-users` edge function from Supabase Dashboard ← **user action**
- [x] 🟢 PWA manifest (`/public/manifest.json`) + Apple Web App metadata in `layout.tsx`

---

## Data & Schema

- [x] 🟢 96 service packages seeded (6 verticals × 4 tiers × 4 segments, INR pricing)
- [x] 🟢 7 demo user accounts (one per role) — see dev-req.md
- [x] 🟢 `communications` table (RLS, indexed)
- [x] 🟢 `delivery_certificates` table with all required fields
- [x] 🟢 `job_issues` / `issue_logs` tables (fault tracking)
- [x] 🟢 `attendance` / `employees` tables (HR)
- [x] 🟢 `whatsapp_templates` / `whatsapp_messages` tables
- [x] 🟢 `job_tasks` table (sub-task breakdown)
- [x] 🟢 Analytics views: `revenue_summary_view`, `technician_performance_view`, `conversion_funnel_view`, `daily_payments_view`
- [x] 🟢 11 DB migrations applied — all column mismatches between code and schema resolved
- [x] 🟢 `bookings`: added `advance_paid_at`, `branch_id`; fixed `total_value` → `total_amount`
- [x] 🟢 `payments`: `payment_mode`, `type`, `created_by` made nullable; `reference_no` → `reference_number`
- [x] 🟢 `invoices`: `customer_name`, `customer_phone` made nullable (using `customer_id` FK instead)
- [x] 🟢 `invoice_items`: `gst_rate`, `gst_amount`, `total` given default 0 (code uses `line_total`)
- [x] 🟢 `quotation_items`: added `service_package_id`, `vertical_id`, `tier`, `segment`, `discount_pct`, `line_total`, `sort_order`
- [x] 🟢 `verticals` + `lost_reasons`: added `sort_order` (seeded 1–6)

- [x] 🟢 Quotation create error redirect fixed — error now shows proper message instead of 404

- [ ] 🟡 `lost_reasons` and `issue_categories` — confirm seeded with realistic data
- [ ] 🟡 `qc_checklist_templates` — confirm seeded per vertical (6 verticals need items)

## What's Left (After Full Build + Schema Fixes)

### PENDING — client actions required first:
1. **GST number** — provide GSTIN for PDF documents (see dev-req.md §4a)
2. **Business logo** — PNG/SVG for PDFs (see dev-req.md §4b)
3. **Employee phone numbers** — real numbers to replace placeholders (see dev-req.md §4c)
4. **Inventory product list** — ~200 SKUs needed to populate inventory module (see dev-req.md §4d)
5. **Production env vars** on hosting platform ← **user action**
6. **Delete `seed-demo-users` edge function** from Supabase Dashboard ← **user action**

### HIGH — before beta:
1. **Advance payment reconciliation** — booking advance not reflected in invoice; customer may pay twice
2. **WhatsApp webhook (receive replies)** — Twilio webhook endpoint needed at `/api/whatsapp/webhook`; currently only outbound
3. **Lead assignment dropdown** — `assignLead` action exists; needs dropdown/button on lead detail
4. **Rework flow UI** — after QC fail: add rework notes to technician, set deadline, re-trigger QC
5. **QC checklist seeding** — `qc_checklist_templates` needs items per vertical (6 verticals)
6. **Issue categories seeding** — `issue_categories` table needs AOTIC-specific fault types

### MEDIUM — polish before stable release:
6. **Inventory search** — filter/search box on `/manager/inventory` page
7. **Salary tracking** — simple payroll records on `/owner/hr`
8. **Monthly attendance view** — per-employee attendance calendar/report
9. **Date range filters on reports** — currently all-time aggregates only
10. **GSTIN on invoice detail page** — currently not displayed

### LOW — after stable release:
11. Charts/graphs on dashboards (currently all numbers)
12. Inventory serial number tracking UI
13. WhatsApp conversations view (tables exist, no frontend)
14. `as any` → Supabase generated types (~50 instances)
