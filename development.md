# AOTIC CRM — Development Checklist (Deployment Readiness)

Last updated: 2026-04-07 (session 8)
Go-live target: First week of April

> **Status (2026-04-07 session 8)**: Complete booking-to-job-card workflow rebuilt end-to-end. Payment proof (Cloudinary upload + reference number), advance % configurable by owner, booking validation trigger fixed (accepts both 'accepted' and 'approved' quotation status). All workshop pages (technician, QC, manager jobs) switched to `createServiceClient()` — jobs now visible to all roles. Technician checklist with "Post Update" notifications added. Activity log visible to manager/owner. `npm run build` passes clean.

## Bugs Fixed (Session 8 — 2026-04-07)

| Bug | Root Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Booking page: "cannot insert non-DEFAULT value into advance_pct" | `advance_pct` is `GENERATED ALWAYS AS (...)` in DB | Removed from INSERT payload in both booking actions |
| Booking page: "Cannot create booking: quotation must be approved (status: accepted)" | DB trigger hardcoded `q_status != 'approved'`; app uses `'accepted'` | Migration 010: trigger now accepts `IN ('accepted', 'approved')` |
| Job card creation: `null value in column "lead_id" violates not-null constraint` | `lead_id` not included in job_cards INSERT | Added `lead_id: booking.lead_id` to INSERT; also fetched from booking data |
| Job card creation: "Please assign an active workshop technician" (with valid tech) | `profiles` RLS blocks regular client from reading other users' profiles | Switched technician/QC profile lookups to `createServiceClient()` |
| Technician dashboard: no jobs shown | `is_assigned_to_job()` RLS function unreliable | Switched to service client + `.eq('assigned_to', user.id)` |
| QC dashboard: no jobs shown | QC inspector has NO SELECT policy on `job_cards` | Switched to service client + `.eq('supervised_by', user.id)` |
| Manager jobs list: no jobs shown | RLS edge cases on multi-branch reads | Switched to `createServiceClient()` |
| Manager jobs detail: profiles join blocked | Regular client can't join other users' profiles | Switched to service client |
| Upload photo page: no jobs shown | Regular client blocked by `job_cards` RLS | Switched to service client |
| Time tracker page: no jobs shown | Same as upload page | Switched to service client |
| Activity log: empty for manager | `audit_logs` RLS restrictive for non-owner | `fetchRecentActivity()` switched to service client |
| Booking validation: 404 on `/sales/bookings/new` | `leads.customer_id` doesn't exist (correct: `converted_customer_id`) | Fixed column; switched to service client |

---

## Bugs Fixed (Session 7 — 2026-04-02)

| Bug | Root Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `npm run build` TypeScript error: `car_brand` in lead edit form | `defaultValues` passed `''` but schema is strict enum | Changed to `undefined` + added `as LeadInput['car_brand']` cast |
| `npm run build` TypeScript error: `car_brand` in lead create form | `onValueChange` passed `string` not enum type | Added `as LeadInput['car_brand']` cast |
| `npm run build` TypeScript error: `inspection_done` missing from status badge | DB enum has `inspection_done` but component CONFIG didn't | Added `inspection_done: { label: 'Inspection Done', variant: 'info' }` |

---

## Bugs Fixed (Session 5 — 2026-04-01)

| Bug | Root Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Quotation new/edit page always shows 404 | `leads` query used non-existent `customer_id` column (correct: `converted_customer_id`) | Changed column in select query |
| Quotation page STILL 404 after column fix | `leads` RLS blocks query when using anon client | Switched to `createServiceClient()` + explicit JS permission check |
| Staff management — "Staff member not found" on remove | Service client `.single()` returned null silently | Use authenticated client `.maybeSingle()` |
| Staff management — "permission denied for table profiles" | `service_role` missing DML grants | `GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO service_role` |
| Staff management — "email already registered" on re-add | Auth user still exists (banned, not deleted) | Added `reactivateStaffMember` action + `ReactivateStaffButton` |
| Attendance not recording on login | Service client failed silently in signIn context | Use authenticated client + add INSERT RLS policy on attendance |
| Date nav skips a day in attendance page | IST timezone offset in `new Date()` | Use `'T00:00:00Z'` + `getUTCDate/setUTCDate` |

---

## Bugs Fixed (Session 4 — 2026-03-31)

| Bug | Root Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `TypeError: Cannot destructure 'label' of CONFIG[status]` on leads page | `LeadStatusBadge` had no fallback for DB status values not in CONFIG map | Added defensive `config ?? fallback` check |
| Clicking a lead row does nothing | Only `contact_name` cell had Link; other cells had no click handler | New `LeadsTableRow` client component with `useRouter().push()` |
| Lead create/edit only allows one vertical | `leads.vertical_id` is single FK | Added `lead_verticals` junction table; multi-select checkboxes |
